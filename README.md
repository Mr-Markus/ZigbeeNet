# What is ZigbeeNet?

ZigbeeNET is a .NET Standard implementation of the Zigbee 3.0 Cluster Library and also includes a support for Texas Instruments CC2531 USB Stick with ZNP firmware to work as a gateway

## What is it for?

With ZigbeeNet you can develop your own .NET application which communicates with zigbee devices

## Important

This library is still under development

## Help needed

I am still looking for a solution to the strict separation of library ZigbeeNet and unpi-net, because serialport is not availible in netstandard. If you have any idea don't hesitat in contacting me via Issue [#3](../../issues/3)
