     * minimum interval, in seconds, between issuing reports of the specified attribute.
     * If minInterval is set to 0x0000, then there is no minimum limit, unless one is
     * imposed by the specification of the cluster using this reporting mechanism or by

     * <b>maxInterval</b>:
     * The maximum reporting interval field is 16 bits in length and shall contain the
     * maximum interval, in seconds, between issuing reports of the specified attribute.
     * If maxInterval is set to 0xffff, then the device shall not issue reports for the specified
     * attribute, and the configuration information for that attribute need not be
     * maintained.
     * <p>
     * <b>reportableChange</b>:
     * The reportable change field shall contain the minimum change to the attribute that
     * will result in a report being issued. This field is of variable length. For attributes
     * with 'analog' data type the field has the same data type as the attribute. The sign (if any) of the reportable
     * change field is ignored.

     * The timeout period field is 16 bits in length and shall contain the maximum
     * expected time, in seconds, between received reports for the attribute specified in
     * the attribute identifier field. If more time than this elapses between reports, this
     * may be an indication that there is a problem with reporting.
     * If timeout is set to 0x0000, reports of the attribute are not subject to timeout.
     * Note that, for a server/client connection to work properly using automatic
     * reporting, the timeout value set for attribute reports to be received by the client (or
     * server) cluster must be set somewhat higher than the maximum reporting interval
     * set for the attribute on the server (or client) cluster.
