    /// This cluster provides attributes and commands to perform mutual authentication and
    /// establish keys between two ZigBee devices.
    /// All Key Establishment messages should be sent with APS retries enabled. A failure to
    /// receive an ACK in a timely manner can be seen as a failure of key establishment. No
    /// Terminate Key Establishment should be sent to the partner of device that has timed out
    /// the operation.
    /// The initiator can initiate the key establishment with any active endpoint on the
    /// responder device that supports the key establishment cluster. The endpoint can be
    /// either preconfigured or discovered, for example, by using ZDO Match_Desc_req. A link
    /// key successfully established using key establishment is valid for all endpoints on a
    /// particular device. The responder shall respond to the initiator using the source
    /// endpoint of the initiator's messages as the destination endpoint of the responder's
    /// messages.
    /// It is expected that the time it takes to perform the various cryptographic computations
    /// of the key establishment cluster may vary greatly based on the device. Therefore rather
    /// than set static timeouts, the Initiate Key Establishment Request and Response
    /// messages will contain approximate values for how long the device will take to generate
    /// the ephemeral data and how long the device will take to generate confirm key message. A
    /// device performing key establishment can use this information in order to choose a
    /// reasonable timeout for its partner during those operations. The timeout should also
    /// take into consideration the time it takes for a message to traverse the network
    /// including APS retries. A minimum transmission time of 2 seconds is recommended.
    /// For the Initiate Key Establishment Response message, it is recommended the initiator
    /// wait at least 2 seconds before timing out the operation. It is not expected that
    /// generating an Initiate Key Establishment Response will take significant time
    /// compared to generating the Ephemeral Data and Confirm Key messages.
