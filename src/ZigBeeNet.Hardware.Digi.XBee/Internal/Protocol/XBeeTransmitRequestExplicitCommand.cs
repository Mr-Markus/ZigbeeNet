    /// specific source and destination endpoints, cluster ID, and profile ID. n For broadcast
    /// transmissions, set the 64-bit destination address to 0x000000000000FFFF. Address the
    /// coordinator by either setting the 64-bit address to all 0x00s and the 16-bit address to
    /// 0xFFFE, or setting the 64-bit address to the coordinator's 64-bit address and the 16-bit
    /// address to 0x0000. n For all other transmissions, setting the 16-bit address to the correct
