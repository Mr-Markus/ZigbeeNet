 Check In Command value object class.
 
 Cluster: Poll Control. Command is sentFROM the server.
  This command is a specific command used for the Poll Control cluster.
 
 * The Poll Control Cluster server sends out a Check-in command to the devices to which it is paired based on the server’s Check-inInterval
 * attribute. It does this to find out if any of the Poll Control Cluster Clients with which it is paired are interested in having it enter fast
 * poll mode so that it can be managed. This request is sent out based on either the Check-inInterval, or the next Check-in value in the Fast Poll
 * Stop Request generated by the Poll Control Cluster Client. * <br> * The Check-in command expects a Check-in Response command to be sent back from the Poll Control Client. If the Poll Control Server does not
 * receive a Check-in response back from the Poll Control Client up to 7.68 seconds it is free to return to polling according to the
 * LongPollInterval. 
  Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
