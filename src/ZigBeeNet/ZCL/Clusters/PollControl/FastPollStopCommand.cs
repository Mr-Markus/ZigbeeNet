 Fast Poll Stop Command value object class.
 
 Cluster: Poll Control. Command is sentTO the server.
  This command is a specific command used for the Poll Control cluster.
 
 * The Fast Poll Stop command is used to stop the fast poll mode initiated by the Check-in response. The Fast Poll Stop command has no payload. * <br> * If the Poll Control Server receives a Fast Poll Stop from an unbound client it SHOULD send back a DefaultResponse with a value field
 * indicating “ACTION_DENIED” . The Server SHALL respond with a DefaultResponse not equal to ZCL_SUCCESS. * <br> * If the Poll Control Server receives a Fast Poll Stop command from a bound client but it is unable to stop fast polling due to the fact that there
 * is another bound client which has requested that polling continue it SHOULD respond with a Default Response with a status of
 * “ACTION_DENIED” * <br> * If a Poll Control Server receives a Fast Poll Stop command from a bound client but it is not FastPolling it SHOULD respond with a Default
 * Response with a status of ACTION_DENIED.
