        The Initiate Test Mode Command
       
       * Certain IAS Zone servers MAY have operational configurations that could be configured OTA or locally on the device. This command enables
       * them to be remotely placed into a test mode so that the user or installer MAY configure their field of view, sensitivity, and other
       * operational parameters. They MAY also verify the placement and proper operation of the IAS Zone server, which MAY have been placed in a
       * difficult to reach location (i.e., making a physical input on the device impractical to trigger).       * <br>       * Another use case for this command is large deployments, especially commercial and industrial, where placing the entire IAS system into
       * test mode instead of a single IAS Zone server is infeasible due to the vulnerabilities that might arise. This command enables only a single
       * IAS Zone server to be placed into test mode.       * <br>       * The biggest limitation of this command is that most IAS Zone servers today are battery-powered sleepy nodes that cannot reliably receive
       * commands. However, implementers MAY decide to program an IAS Zone server by factory default to maintain a limited duration of normal
       * polling upon initialization/joining to a new network. Some IAS Zone servers MAY also have AC mains power and are able to receive commands.
       * Some types of IAS Zone servers that MAY benefit from this command are: motion sensors and fire sensor/smoke alarm listeners (i.e., a device
       * that listens for a non-communicating fire sensor to alarm and communicates this to the IAS CIE).       </summary>
