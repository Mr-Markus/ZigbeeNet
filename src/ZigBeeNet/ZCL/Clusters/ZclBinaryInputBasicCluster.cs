Binary Input (Basic)cluster implementation (Cluster ID 0x000F).
 
 * The Binary Input (Basic) cluster provides an interface for reading the value of a binary measurement and accessing various
 * characteristics of that measurement. The cluster is typically used to implement a sensor that measures a two-state physical quantity. 
  Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!
