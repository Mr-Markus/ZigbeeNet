<summary>
OTA Upgradecluster implementation (Cluster ID 0x0019).
 
 * The cluster provides a standard way to upgrade devices in the network via OTA messages. Thus the upgrade process MAY be performed between two
 * devices from different manufacturers. Devices are required to have application bootloader and additional memory space in order to
 * successfully implement the cluster. * <p> * It is the responsibility of the server to indicate to the clients when update images are available. The client MAY be upgraded or
 * downgraded64. The upgrade server knows which client devices to upgrade and to what file version. The upgrade server MAY be notified of such
 * information via the backend system. For ZR clients, the server MAY send a message to notify the device when an updated image is available. It
 * is assumed that ZED clients will not be awake to receive an unsolicited notification of an available image. All clients (ZR and ZED) SHALL
 * query (poll) the server periodically to determine whether the server has an image update for them. Image Notify is optional. * <p> * The cluster is implemented in such a way that the client service works on both ZED and ZR devices. Being able to handle polling is mandatory for
 * all server devices while being able to send a notify is optional. Hence, all client devices must be able to use a ‘poll’ mechanism to send query
 * message to the server in order to see if the server has any new file for it. The polling mechanism also puts fewer resources on the upgrade
 * server. It is ideal to have the server maintain as little state as possible since this will scale when there are hundreds of clients in the
 * network. The upgrade server is not required to keep track of what pieces of an image that a particular client has received; instead the client
 * SHALL do that. Lastly poll makes more sense for devices that MAY need to perform special setup to get ready to receive an image, such as
 * unlocking flash or allocating space for the new image. 
  Code is auto-generated. Modifications may be overwritten!

        The Upgrade End Response
       
       * When an upgrade server receives an Upgrade End Request command with a status of       * INVALID_IMAGE, REQUIRE_MORE_IMAGE, or ABORT, no additional processing shall be done       * in its part. If the upgrade server receives an Upgrade End Request command with a status of       * SUCCESS, it shall generate an Upgrade End Response with the manufacturer code and image type       * received in the Upgrade End Request along with the times indicating when the device should upgrade       * to the new image.       * <br>       * The server may send an unsolicited Upgrade End Response command to the client. This may be used       * for example if the server wants to synchronize the upgrade on multiple clients simultaneously. For       * client devices, the upgrade server may unicast or broadcast Upgrade End Response command       * indicating a single client device or multiple client devices shall switch to using their new images. The       * command may not be reliably received by sleepy devices if it is sent unsolicited.       </summary>

        The Query Specific File Response
       
       * The server sends Query Specific File Response after receiving Query Specific File Request from a       * client. The server shall determine whether it first supports the Query Specific File Request command.       * Then it shall determine whether it has the specific file being requested by the client using all the       * information included in the request. The upgrade server sends a Query Specific File Response with       * one of the following status: SUCCESS, NO_IMAGE_AVAILABLE or NOT_AUTHORIZED.       * <br>       * A status of NO_IMAGE_AVAILABLE indicates that the server currently does not have the device       * specific file available for the client. A status of NOT_AUTHORIZED indicates the server is not       * authorized to send the file to the client.       </summary>
