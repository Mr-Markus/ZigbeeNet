<summary>
Poll Controlcluster implementation (Cluster ID 0x0020).
 
 * This cluster provides a mechanism for the management of an end device’s MAC Data Request rate. * For the purposes of this cluster, the term “poll” always refers to the sending of a MAC Data * Request from the end device to the end device’s parent. This cluster can be used for instance * by a configuration device to make an end device responsive for a certain period of time so that * the device can be managed by the controller. This cluster is composed of a client and server. The end device implements the server side of this
 * cluster. The server side contains several attributes related to the MAC Data Request rate for the device. The client side implements
 * commands used to manage the poll rate for the device. The end device which implements the server side of this cluster sends a query to the
 * client on a predetermined interval to see if the client would like to manage the poll period of the end device in question. When the client side
 * of the cluster hears from the server it has the opportunity to respond with configuration data to either put the end device in a short poll mode
 * or let the end device continue to function normally.
