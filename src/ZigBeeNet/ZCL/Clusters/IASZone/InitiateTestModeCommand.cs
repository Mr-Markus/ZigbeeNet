 Initiate Test Mode Command value object class.
 
 Cluster: IAS Zone. Command is sentTO the server.
  This command is a specific command used for the IAS Zone cluster.
 
 * Certain IAS Zone servers MAY have operational configurations that could be configured OTA or locally on the device. This command enables
 * them to be remotely placed into a test mode so that the user or installer MAY configure their field of view, sensitivity, and other
 * operational parameters. They MAY also verify the placement and proper operation of the IAS Zone server, which MAY have been placed in a
 * difficult to reach location (i.e., making a physical input on the device impractical to trigger). * <br> * Another use case for this command is large deployments, especially commercial and industrial, where placing the entire IAS system into
 * test mode instead of a single IAS Zone server is infeasible due to the vulnerabilities that might arise. This command enables only a single
 * IAS Zone server to be placed into test mode. * <br> * The biggest limitation of this command is that most IAS Zone servers today are battery-powered sleepy nodes that cannot reliably receive
 * commands. However, implementers MAY decide to program an IAS Zone server by factory default to maintain a limited duration of normal
 * polling upon initialization/joining to a new network. Some IAS Zone servers MAY also have AC mains power and are able to receive commands.
 * Some types of IAS Zone servers that MAY benefit from this command are: motion sensors and fire sensor/smoke alarm listeners (i.e., a device
 * that listens for a non-communicating fire sensor to alarm and communicates this to the IAS CIE).
